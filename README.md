  🧙‍♂️ How to Use 🧙‍♂️
-  Set BashBunny to Arming mode (Closest to the USB Dongle)

-  Place payload.txt and collect.ps1 into switch 1 or 2 it really doesn't matter

-  BashBunnyDrive (E:\payloads\switch 1\payload.txt)

-  Eject Bash Bunny

-  Place to the correct Switch Setting, furthest from dongle is Switch 1 middle is Switch 2

-  Insert into target machine, When the light turns solid green the script has run successfully leave in for as long as possible to copy as much as possible

-  When finished or spotted remove and run away screaming
